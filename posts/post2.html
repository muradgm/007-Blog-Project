								<h3>Synopsis</h3>
								<p>
									On a rogue mission in Mexico City Bond kills an assassin. Back
									in London, Bond is grounded by M but confides in Moneypenny
									that he was acting on orders from the previous M before she
									died. Bond travels to Rome and infiltrates a secret meeting,
									but their leader Franz Oberhauser, reveals Bond’s presence.
									The terrifying Hinx pursues Bond in a car chase. In Austria,
									Bond meets his old nemesis Mr White and makes a promise to
									keep Mr White’s daughter safe in exchange for leading him to
									Oberhauser. The daughter, Dr Madeleine Swann, is reluctant to
									help, but after Bond rescues her from Hinx she agrees. She
									reveals the secret organisation is SPECTRE. Swann leads Bond
									to Tangier and from there they journey by train to a desert
									location, Swann makes Bond question the life he has chosen for
									himself. Hinx appears and a vicious fight ensues. At a
									high-tech facility in the desert Bond and Swann meet
									Oberhauser, He amasses information to manipulate events and is
									about to gain control of a global surveillance network. After
									Oberhauser tortures Bond and reveals himself to be Ernst
									Stavro Blofeld, Bond and Swann escape and destroy the base. In
									London Bond debriefs M, is captured by Blofeld, then rescues
									Swann. Bond has the opportunity to kill Blofeld but decides to
									let him live. Bond joins Swann, leaving his old life behind.

								<h3>Trivia</h3>
								<p>
									The pre-title Day of the Dead sequence employed 1,520 extras,
									dressed and made up by 107 different make-up artists, 98 of
									whom were local. On each working day it took three and a half
									hours to get the crowd prepared
								</p>

								<p>
									Red Bull helicopter that featured in the pre-title sequence is
									built especially for barrel-rolling and free-diving and
									piloted by aerobatic pilot Chuck Aaron
								</p>

								<p>
									<em>Spectre</em> marked the first time Bond has filmed in
									Rome, Italy
								</p>

								<p>
									It was also the first time Aston Martin and the Bond
									production team collaborated on creating a new car designed
									specifically for the film with the DB10
								</p>

								<p>
									SMDNtefan Zurcher began looking for appropriate locations in
									Switzerland, Austria, Italy and France, 12 months before
									shooting commenced. His first Bond film was On Her Majesty’s
									Secret Service where he played a Piz Gloria guard. He
									continued to work on eight more Bond films in different
									capacities. He is also known as “The Snowman”
								</p>

								<p>
									The exterior of the Ice Q in Solden was selected for the start
									of the chase. The main outdoor set was constructed in
									Obertilliach, a small village with 500 inhabitants in the
									Austrian Tirol
								</p>

								<p>
									Two 20 tonne cranes were used in order to simulate the flight
									in the forest. The plane was 18m wide and the path through the
									trees was only 20m wide. Special carbon fibre cables were used
									between the cranes. Laser equipment was used to ensure the one
									kilometre path through the trees was in a straight line
								</p>

								<p>
									A snow team of 30 people worked round the clock to guarantee
									perfect snow conditions on the road and in the forest
								</p>

								<p>
									Spectre includes a Guinness World Record for the largest on
									screen explosion (of Blofeld’s lair)
